   Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
   (optional), the command, and the command parameters (of which there
   may be up to 15).  The prefix, command, and all parameters are
   separated by one (or more) ASCII space character(s) (0x20).

   The presence of a prefix is indicated with a single leading ASCII
   colon character (':', 0x3b), which must be the first character of the
   message itself.  There must be no gap (whitespace) between the colon
   and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
   origin of the message.  If the prefix is missing from the message, it
   is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was
   received.  Clients should not use prefix when sending a message from
   themselves; if they use a prefix, the only valid prefix is the
   registered nickname associated with the client.  If the source
   identified by the prefix cannot be found from the server's internal
   database, or if the source is registered from a different link than
   from which the message arrived, the server must ignore the message
   silently.


   IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
   (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
   exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
   the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
   for the command and its parameters.
